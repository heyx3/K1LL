//Basic camera functionality: UVN rotation, transform calculation, etc.
//Has two modes, indicated by the "LockUp" flag:
//   - If "LockUp" is true, the camera's Up vector will not be affected by pitching,
//        and the Forward vector can only get so close to it (specified by "ClosestDotVariance").
//   - If "LockUp" is false, the camera's Up vector is not locked in any way.
//Note that rolling this camera or rotating it with a Quaternion will change the Up vector
//    regardless of "LockUp".
